"""End-to-end column lineage for qualified stars, against the starshop example.

The unit tests in test_column_parser.py drive parse_column_lineage directly with
hand-written SQL. These run the whole pipeline over real committed dbt artifacts
instead, so a regression shows up the same way a user would meet it: as columns
missing from the lineage graph.

starshop exists for this. See examples/starshop/README.md — no other example
project selects a qualified star in an outermost SELECT, so before it, breaking
star expansion left every fixture green.

        column name so it cannot hold two entries anyway. The warehouse still
