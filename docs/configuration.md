# Configuration

Docglow works out of the box with zero configuration. For customization, add a `docglow.yml` to your dbt project root.

## Generate a Starter Config

```bash
docglow init
```

This creates a `docglow.yml` with all options documented and commented out.

## Theme

Docglow supports three themes: `auto` (follows system preference), `light`, and `dark`.

```bash
docglow generate --theme dark
```

Or in `docglow.yml`:

```yaml
theme: dark
```

See [Health Scoring](health-scoring.md) for detailed documentation of each dimension, weight rationale, and customization.

## Lineage Layers

See [Customizing Lineage Layers](lineage-layers.md) for a complete guide on defining custom layers and rules, including a real-world example.

## Column Lineage

See [Column-Level Lineage](column-lineage.md) for setup, incremental analysis, and troubleshooting.

## Lineage badge display

The column-level lineage column on a model page renders a small pill for each upstream/downstream reference. When your project has long snake_case names (e.g. `fact_orders_by_supplier_over_time_by_state_and_segment`), those pills can grow wide enough to overlap adjacent UI. `ui.lineage_badge.abbreviation` controls how the name is shortened in the compact form. The full name always remains available in the tooltip and on row hover.

| Strategy   | What it does | Example (`fact_orders_by_supplier_over_time_by_state_and_segment`) |
|---|---|---|
| `smart` *(default)* | Collapses leading snake_case segments to single-letter initials joined by `·`, keeping the distinguishing tail intact | `f·o·b·s·o·t·b·s·a·segment` |
| `truncate` | Keeps the first N characters and appends `…` — simplest and closest to `dbt docs` behavior | `fact_orders_by_supplier_over_t...` |
| `middle` | Keeps both the prefix (`fct_` / `stg_`) and the suffix, inserting `…` in the middle | `fact_orders_by_supplie…segment` |
| `none` | Renders the full name; relies on the badge's CSS max-width plus the tooltip for overflow | `fact_orders_by_supplier_over_time_by_state_and_segment` |

`max_model_chars` and `max_column_chars` set the character threshold at which abbreviation kicks in (they have no effect on `none`). Defaults are 30 and 22 respectively; raise them if you want longer names to render in full, lower them if you want more aggressive shortening.

!!! tip
    Not sure which to pick? Start with `smart` (the default) — it preserves the most unique part of the name. If your team expects names to match `dbt docs` output exactly, switch to `truncate`.
